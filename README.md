# hello-world-ting
This marks the very first day of me working as a software engineer at INVOKE.

This changes I have made on this file is that I add some introduction about myself.
I am a civil engineer-turn-software engineer. 
I have learned Html, CSS, JavaScript, R and Python in the last six months.
